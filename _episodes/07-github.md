Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world.  Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `planets`:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](../fig/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository".

Note: Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave 
"Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked, and keep "None" as options for both "Add 
.gitignore" and "Add a license." See the "GitHub License and README files" exercise below for a full 
explanation of why the repository needs to be empty.

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](../fig/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](../fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

~~~
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn't contain any files yet.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote]({{ page.root}}{% link reference.md %}#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-find-repo-string.png)

Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the [protocol]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#protocol) from SSH to HTTPS.

> ## HTTPS vs. SSH
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.  After
> the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by
> following one of the great tutorials from
> [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
> [Atlassian/Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html)
> and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/)
> (this one has a screencast).
{: .callout}

![Changing the Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-change-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `planets` repository, and run
this command:

~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only
difference should be your username instead of `vlad`.

`origin` is a local name used to refer to the remote repository. It could be called
anything, but `origin` is a convention that is often used by default in git
and GitHub, so it's helpful to stick with this unless there's a reason not to.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

~~~
$ git remote -v
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
~~~
{: .output}

We'll discuss remotes in more detail in the next episode, while
talking about how they might be used for collaboration.

Once the remote is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin master
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Proxy
>
> If the network you are connected to uses a proxy, there is a chance that your
> last command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To
> solve this issue, you need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> $ git config --global https.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy, you will need to
> tell Git to disable the proxy using:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

> ## Password Managers
>
> If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will
> try to use it when it needs your username and password.  For example, this
> is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your
> username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager,
> type:
>
> ~~~
> $ unset SSH_ASKPASS
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> in the terminal, before you run `git push`.  Despite the name, [Git uses
> `SSH_ASKPASS` for all credential
> entry](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials), so
> you may want to unset `SSH_ASKPASS` whether you are using Git via SSH or
> https.
>
> You may also want to add `unset SSH_ASKPASS` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`
> to make Git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords.
{: .callout}

> ## The '-u' Flag
>
> You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.  This
> option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option for the `git branch`
> command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so
> that the `git pull` command can be used without any arguments. To do this,
> simply use `git push -u origin master` once the remote has been set up.
{: .callout}

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

~~~
$ git pull origin master
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
~~~
{: .output}

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

> ## GitHub GUI
>
> Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub.
> Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number).
> Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
> What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
> How would you get that same information in the shell?
>
> > ## Solution
> > The left-most button (with the picture of a clipboard) copies the full identifier of the commit 
> > to the clipboard. In the shell, ```git log``` will show you the full commit identifier for each 
> > commit.
> >
> > When you click on the middle button, you'll see all of the changes that were made in that 
> > particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red ones removals. In the shell we 
> > can do the same thing with ```git diff```. In particular, ```git diff ID1..ID2``` where ID1 and 
> > ID2 are commit identifiers (e.g. ```git diff a3bf1e5..041e637```) will show the differences 
> > between those two commits.
> >
> > The right-most button lets you view all of the files in the repository at the time of that 
> > commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the repository at that particular time. 
> > We can do this with ```git checkout ID``` where ID is the identifier of the commit we want to 
> > look at. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state 
> > afterwards!

> ## Push vs. Commit
>
> In this lesson, we introduced the "git push" command.
> How is "git push" different from "git commit"?
>
> > ## Solution
> > When we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it with the changes 
> > we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the changes we've made with others). 
> > Commit only updates your local repository.
