We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren't collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:

We've all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word's 
[Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), 
Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or 
LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document.

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can 
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a [commit]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#commit)), and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository).
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.
